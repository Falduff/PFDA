<h1 style="font-size:25px;">Single-Cell Analysis Notebook</h1>

<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Overview</h2>
<p style="font-size:15px;">This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Single-cell analysis is a technique used to study the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells, enabling the identification of distinct cell populations, their states, and functions. This approach is crucial for exploring cellular heterogeneity, uncovering rare cell types, and understanding how cell populations differ in health and disease, including conditions like COVID-19.</p>
